# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
- Very confident - I was reasonably certain of my knowledge and understanding of the comparison operators before doing the assignment, but after completing the Comparisons, If Statements, and all three Code Challenges I feel that I have a really good grasp of those operators and can integrate or build on them fairly easily.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
- Reasonably confident - I do still need to spend a quick moment to make sure that I am using the right operator for the output I want, but I do believe that I will quickly become better and faster and more comfortable with them.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
- Very confident - I believe that I have an excellent grasp on the flow of Ruby logic in if statements and the variant statements, and I found it quick and easy to grasp the desired result of the assignments using them.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
- Roughly two hours, including time to record a short video and a few breaks; I had set aside three hours and expected to come in somewhat under that mark, but I was a little surprised by how quickly things clicked.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- I still need to work on logical operators, as I said before, and I also need to remember to always type out the second equal sign in an equal-equal comparison operator. I'm going to work on including logical operators and double equal comparisons wherever appropriate into the following assignments and work out how to integrate them better by doing so. I already have a portion of time included into every study time and assignment schedule on my calendar specifically for that kind of experimentation and practice.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- I'm curious as to the other logical operators and how they would best be used, as well as how other operations can be incorporated into if-branches. I'll use the internet in addition to asking questions when appropriate during sessions or pairing, and should I encounter a major obstacle I'll reach out to my TA and small group for potential alternatives.
